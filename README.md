# E-Commerce website html css

I developed a fully functional e-commerce website using HTML and CSS. The site showcases a variety of products, including shoes, t-shirts, watches, and smartphones. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to browse products easily. I incorporated forms for user interaction, such as product web forms for adding new items, and customer forms for registration and login.

The project also includes a user dashboard, where registered users can manage their profiles and view their order history. The forms are integrated with SQL databases to handle data storage and retrieval efficiently. This setup not only allows users to register and log in but also enables them to interact with the product catalog and track their purchases. Overall, the project demonstrates a practical application of web development skills and database management, providing a solid foundation for future e-commerce solutions.
